# castle-lab
This is current not in a state that is useable in any form, but some parts of the initial proof-of-concept work and the larger design exists, including creating namespaces on-demand.

The larger project design is toward a platform that allows the creation of containerized lab environments, providing multiple containers for lab targets as well as tooling containers - ideally presented via web UI, for performing application security / app pen testing training exercises.

There's a "napkin" sketch of the solution design in the whiteboard.jpg file in the root, for now. That should be concerted to real diagrams at some point.
